This preview for my audio narrative shows the very beginnings of the project.  The idea is to do a day in the life of me as a student living in south Oakland.  So far, I have thrown in 5 different pieces of audio into the project.  It starts out with the typical iPhone alarm that makes me cringe every time I hear it. Then you hear a door open, and a faucet being turned on and running.  The premise is that I woke up and went straight into the bathroom.  Then, while the faucet is running, you can hear me brushing my teeth over the audio of the faucet.  Once I am done brushing, I turn on the shower and get in.  The original audio clip of the shower was relatively long compared to the entire length that the project will be, so I decided to cut out some of the middle.  The transition is smooth enough to where you cannot really tell that I did it.  I should say that I am not including every single sound that I would hear when I am getting ready for the day.  For example, I am not including the sound of me walking from my bedroom to the bathroom.  I do not really think I have to be that explicit for this project, but I am curious if that is something I should actually include.   What I want to start adding the next time I work on the project would be the sounds of me making breakfast.  I want to add the sounds of bacon sizzling on a pan, me cracking eggs and maybe even a toaster popping.  I will also definitely add the sound of my Keurig being turned on because I am always using that thing.  I think after the sounds of me making breakfast, I will probably add the sounds of me being in class.  Perhaps me taking notes or even the professor lecturing a little.
